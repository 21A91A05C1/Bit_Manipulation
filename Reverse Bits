Reverse Bits
Program Description :
In the digital realm of Binaryland, an ancient script has been discovered that can only be deciphered by reversing
the binary representation of a 32-bit number. Your mission is to implement a program that takes a 32-bit integer, reverses its binary form, and then prints the result in decimal.

Input Format :  
The input consists of a single 32-bit integer, denoted as X.

Output Format :
Print a single line containing the decimal representation of the reversed binary form.

Input :
1


Output :
2147483648 


Constraints :
0<=N<=232













//code


n=int(input())
k=bin(n)[2:]
while(len(k)<32):
    k='0'+k;
k=k[::-1]
print(int(k,2))
