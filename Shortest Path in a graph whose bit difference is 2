Shortest path
Program Description :
The shortest path length between two given nodes such that adjacent nodes are at bit difference 2

Given an Unweighted and Undirected graph consisting of N nodes and two integers a and b. The edge between any two nodes exists only if thebit difference between them is 2, the task is to find the length of the shortest Path between nodes a and b. If a path does not exist between the nodes a and b, then print -1. 

Input Format :
First line contains three integers N , a and b. 

Output Format :
Print the shortest path if exits otherwise print -1. 

Input :
15 15 3


Output :
1
